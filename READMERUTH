the shell script quartetsfromlist.sh takes a file containing a list of newick gene trees as input andthen makes a file that contains the output quartets formatted for input to wQMC. I need to comment ou a bunch of testing stuff and then get the pipeline running on campus cluster before the experiments will be done.  

Also, will need to do side by side comparison of wQMC analysis on ASTRAL-II 50 taxon data sets with all 50 choose 4 quartets. This should be enough experiment for IEEE/TCBB paper.
