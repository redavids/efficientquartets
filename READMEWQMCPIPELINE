Most summary methods use files of gene trees to produce a species trees. The shell script quartetsfromlist.sh takes a file containing a list of newick gene trees as input andthen makes a file that contains the output quartets formatted for input to wQMC.  

The script quartetsfromlist.sh requires the scripts efficientquartetsfromgtfile.sh, quartetstoweightedquartets.py, getridofedgeweights.py

File paths will have to be updated in all of the scripts.  All of the scripts mus be in the same directory to run.  

For the scripts to work on your machine, you must have dendropy installed, available at http://dendropy.org/   

Dendropy also has a google users group and github with the most up-to-date information.  

These scripts have only been tested on a Macintosh OSX 10.9.5
