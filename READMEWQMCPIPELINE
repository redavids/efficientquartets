Most summary methods use files of gene trees to produce a species trees. The shell script quartetsfromlist.sh takes a file containing a list of newick gene trees as input, and then makes a file that contains the output quartets formatted for input to wQMC.  

The script quartetsfromlist.sh requires the scripts efficientquartetsfromgtfile.sh, quartetstoweightedquartets.py, getridofedgeweights.py. These all must be in the same directory.

File paths will have to be updated in all of the scripts.  

For the scripts to work on your machine, you must have dendropy installed, available at http://dendropy.org/   

Dendropy also has a google users group and github with the most up-to-date information.  

These scripts have been tested on a Macintosh OSX 10.9.5 and Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS operating systems. Please contact redavid2@illinois.edu for bug reports or questions.
