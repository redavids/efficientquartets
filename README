To get n-2 choose 2(n = num taxa) quartets from newick string (one tree) stored in file 'infile' and print them in 'quarfile' run
(note that you should probably end string with ';' becuase treedist needs it)
	
	./treequar.sh infile quarfile

To (in addition to finding the quartets and printing them) run the quartets through max-cut and
check the returned value of max-cut (stored in file 'intree2') against the original tree in 'infile' using treedist run

	./treequar.sh -c infile quarfile

To return "efficient" quartets use the -e option 

	./treequar.sh -e infile quarfile


NOTE: Do not use the following file names for trees or quarfiles (as maxcut or tree cut will overwrite them)
	intree
	intree2
	outfile
